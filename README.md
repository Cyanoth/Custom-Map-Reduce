MapReduce is a framework for processing and generating information from big data sets. The concept is ideal for parallelisation and the results can be used to make informed business decisions or extract useful information from given data. For this assignment, a prototype program was developed in Java which replicated the operations of a MapReduce framework. 

By following an object-oriented design and includes multi-threading for the various processes, the program successfully completed objectives set in the assignment specification and was robust by validating and handling unexpected data.
